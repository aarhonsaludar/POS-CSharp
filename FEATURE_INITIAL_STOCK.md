# ?? New Feature: Initial Stock When Adding Items

## Summary
You can now add items with initial stock quantity directly from the Maintenance form! This eliminates the need to use the Delivery form for newly created items.

## Before (Old Workflow)
1. Maintenance ? Items ? Add Item (without stock)
2. Delivery ? Select Item ? Add Stock
3. Now item is ready for sale

## After (New Workflow) ?
1. Maintenance ? Items ? Add Item **with Initial Stock**
2. Item is ready for sale immediately!

---

## How to Use

### Adding an Item with Initial Stock

1. **Navigate to**: Main Menu ? Maintenance ? Items Tab

2. **Fill in the form**:
   - **Item Name**: Enter the product name
   - **Category**: Select from dropdown
   - **Base Price**: Enter the selling price
   - **Initial Stock**: Enter the starting quantity (0-100,000)

3. **Click "Add Item"**

4. **Done!** The item is created and stock is set in one transaction

### Visual Changes

#### Items Tab - New Field
```
Item Name:      [________________]

| Item ID | Item Name | Category  | Base Price | Current Stock |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| 1       | Coke      | Beverages | ?45.00     | 100           |
| 2       | Chips     | Snacks    | ?25.00     | 50            |

## Technical Details

### Database Operations
When you add an item with initial stock, the system performs:

1. **INSERT** into `Items` table:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Items (ItemName, CategoryId, BasePrice) 
   VALUES ('Coke', 1, 45.00)
   ```

2. **INSERT** into `Inventory` table (if stock > 0):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Inventory (ItemId, Quantity) 
   VALUES (1, 100)
   ```

Both operations are wrapped in a **transaction** to ensure data consistency.

### Code Changes

#### MaintenanceForm.Designer.cs
- Added `NumericUpDown nudInitialStock` control
- Added `Label lblInitialStock` control
- Positioned controls in Items panel

#### MaintenanceForm.cs
- Modified `btnAddItem_Click()`:
  - Added transaction support
  - Gets `LastInsertedId` for new item
  - Inserts into Inventory if stock > 0
  - Shows stock in success message

- Modified `LoadItems()`:
  - Added `LEFT JOIN` with Inventory table
  - Shows "Current Stock" column in grid

## Notes

?? **Transaction Safety**: All database operations are in a transaction. If any step fails, nothing is saved.

? **Backward Compatible**: You can still use the Delivery form to add stock to existing items.

? **Stock Update**: Initial Stock only applies when creating the item. To add more stock later, use Delivery form.

?? **Tip**: Set Initial Stock to 0 if you're just setting up the product catalog without physical inventory.

## Comparison with Delivery Form

| Feature | Add Item (New) | Delivery Form |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Purpose | Create new items | Add stock to existing items |
| When to use | First time setup | Replenishment |
| Creates Item | ? Yes | ? No |
| Sets Stock | ? Yes | ? Yes |
| Updates Stock | ? No | ? Yes |
| Transaction ID | ? No | ? Yes (DeliveryId) |
| Delivery Date | ? No | ? Yes |

**Best Practice**: 
- Use **Add Item** for initial product setup
- Use **Delivery** for recording supplier deliveries
